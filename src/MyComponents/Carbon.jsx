                    Inflatable spacecraft modules are revolutionary structures designed to provide a habitable environment for astronauts in space.
         These modules are made of lightweight, durable materials that can be easily inflated with a gas, such as air or nitrogen, to 
         create a spacious and comfortable living space. The inflatable design allows for a significant increase in volume compared to
          traditional rigid spacecraft modules, enabling a wider range of activities and improving the overall quality of life for astronauts on
           long-duration missions.

Inflatable spacecraft modules offer numerous benefits, including:

                        <li> - Increased volume and habitable space
                        </li>
                        <li> - Reduced launch costs due to lighter and more compact design
                        </li>
                        <li>-Enhanced structural flexibility and adaptability
